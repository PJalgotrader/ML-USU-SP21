# Machine Learning

Repository for machine learning courses owned and maintained by prof. Jahangiry

* The [main](https://github.com/PJalgotrader/Machine_Learning-USU/tree/main) branch contains some general machine learning contents including data, cheatsheets, Google Colab tutorials, PyCaret and etc.
* To get access to the materials for older semesters, please check out existing branches (spring22, fall22, ...) 
* Latest lecture slides and Python notebooks should be found under the [fall22](https://github.com/PJalgotrader/Machine_Learning-USU/tree/fall22) branch!
